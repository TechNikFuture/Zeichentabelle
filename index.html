<span style="color:blue">which was at a café called ‘Coffee Paradise,’</span>** really wasn't paradise. The hours were very long, and the pay, **<span style="color:blue">which was sometimes late,</span>** wasn't very good. My boss, **<span style="color:green">whose name I'm happy to say I've now forgotten,</span>** was often impolite to the workers. He was one of those bosses **<span style="color:green">who nobody likes.</span>** Once he told me **<span style="color:blue">I had to work for 15 hours in one day,</span>** **<span style="color:blue">which I later found out is totally illegal.</span>** It was that kind of thing that made me decide to look for a better job. I wanted something **<span style="color:blue">that paid a bit better and that wasn’t such long hours.</span>** I also wanted to work for somebody **<span style="color:blue">that was a bit nicer.</span>** Now I work in a market, **<span style="color:blue">which is much better from my point of view.</span>** It's the type of permanent market **<span style="color:blue">you find inside a big building called 'market hall’ or ‘covered market.’</span>** It's only open six hours a day, **<span style="color:blue">but my boss, who's great, pays me about the same as I was getting for a 50-hour week in the café.</span>** Most of the other people **<span style="color:green">who work in the market are really nice too.</span>** **<span style="color:green">I've been here for four years,</span>** **<span style="color:green">which is much longer than I expected.</span>**
